## 1. Introduction

While _<beyond\_the\_equation/>_ began as an ambitious talk series exploring the
depths of **Science**, **Technology**, **Engineering**, and **Mathematics**
(STEM), time didn’t allow those talks to fully take shape. The vision, however,
lives on—reimagined as a collection of interactive notebooks and experimental
resources.

Initiated by [@debarchito](https://github.com/debarchito) with the support of
`GDG on Campus | AdtU`, this project has evolved into a personal, open-ended
journey through STEM ideas that are often overlooked, underexplored, or just fun
to think about.

I don’t know exactly who this will help—maybe no one. But these notebooks give
form to scattered thoughts I enjoyed playing with: ideas too weird, too niche,
or too incomplete to be "useful" in the conventional sense. It's a public lab
notebook—open to anyone curious enough to explore.

That said, don’t treat it as a tutorial library or curriculum. It’s a
sandbox—visual experiments, weird math, and “what if” questions. You’re invited
to read, remix, or fork. If it makes you think a little differently, it’s done
its job.
