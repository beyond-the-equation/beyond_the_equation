## 1. Introduction

A dynamic talk series dedicated to exploring the depths of **Science**,
**Technology**, **Engineering**, and **Mathematics** (STEM)! We break down
complex concepts through structured discussions, hands-on learning sessions and
resources.

Initiated by [@debarchito](https://github.com/debarchito) and made possible
through the support of `GDG on Campus | AdtU`, this project is our humble
attempt to shed light on some of the lesser-known but incredibly fascinating
fields within `STEM`. While we understand these areas may not always have
immediate practical applications (or maybe they do?), we believe they offer a
rewarding experience that broadens perspectives. Our goal is to offer a glimpse
into the world beyond the mainstream, encouraging a deeper appreciation for the
diversity of thought and exploration that `STEM` has to offer.
